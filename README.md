# omarchy-tweak
My preferred additional setup for a fresh [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) install.

Based on Typecraft's [omarchy-supplement](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/omarchy-supplement),
but hyprland overrides are managed a bit differently so you see them when using Menu > Setup > XXXX.

Clone it maybe to ```$HOME/omarchy-tweak``` and run from there.

## Notable Changes

* Brave installed and set as default browser
* Keepass installed and set to SUPER SHIFT SLASH
* Assumes low-res 1080p display
* Caps Lock mapped to Esc
* Pause key mapped to Compose

## TODO

* Uninstall unused apps?  1password, ...
* Screensaver / lock settings
